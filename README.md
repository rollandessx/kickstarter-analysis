# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to import data into a table, clean the data and perfoprm some formatting task on the data so it is easily analysed.

### Analysis and Challenges
It was a lot of  data to start scrambling through, using the pivot table helped saved a lot of downtime. Using the conditional formatting helps to highlight cells with values and also helps visualization of data by creating bars with colors.

There was really no challenge in the project but i believe the possible challenge that can occur is using the wrong equation to detremine values from two cells, like the mean, average and standard deviation, if the right equation is not used it will produce wrong data.

From the Theater and Outcomes by Launch Date it is obvious that there is success year round compare to the failed and canceled date. Froim the line graph it simply show much more successful lunch dates at the month of May and June.

From the Outcome Based on Goal line graph we can see a trumendous growth at the beggining but gradually failed as the goal increases. We experienced a greater failure rate at 45000 to 49999 goal.
